<p class="indent">This little sketch was prepared very hurriedly
in order to give scope to the volunteer
efforts of certain of the younger members of
the community who had undertaken to provide
the entertainment for the Christmas celebration of
1910 of the Peace Dale Congregational Sunday
School.</p>

<p class="indent">After looking patiently and long for something
which they could act for the entertainment of
their fellows, they despaired of finding anything
they would like.</p>

<p class="indent">In their dilemma they appealed to me, saying
that their principal desire was to introduce the
singing of Christmas carols in some way not too
commonplace.</p>

<p class="indent">The characters were taken by inexperienced
actors who, nevertheless, presented the masque in
a very genuine and convincing manner.</p>

<p class="indent">The whole time of action was about thirty-five
minutes, including the singing of the Christmas
carols. I was urged to amplify the action, in
order to somewhat prolong the part played by
Robin Hood and his men, but, after some effort
in this direction, I gave it up, as the principal
merit of the masque seemed to me to be its
brevity.</p>

<p class="indent">Several friends have urged its preservation
in print in the hope that it may prove suggestive
or useful to others in like predicament.</p>
